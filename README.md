# nvim_config for lua
Backup of nvim config files.

# Fast Installation
Run the experimental and highly(maybe) dangerous `install.sh`.

# Installation
1. Install NeoVim with aptitude `sudo apt install neovim`
2. Clone this repo to `~/.config/nvim/
3. Install python support with `sudo apt-get install python3-neovim`
4. Install Node-JS from [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md)
5. Verify installation with `:checkhealth lazy` in nvim to verify plugin manager is installed correctly. To then check all installed plugins run `:Lazy check`.
